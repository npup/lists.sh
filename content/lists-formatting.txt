# Description of files that produce lists like this

## The file and its structure

The files shall be of type `.txt`
They may (but need not) start with some metadata-entries (see below)
Then follows any headings and lists (se formatting instructions below)
You can look at the source file for this very list here:
    => https://github.com/npup/lists.sh/blob/master/content/lists-formatting.txt



## Metadata - data about the list itself

A metadata entry is indicated by entering a line like `=: <key> <value>`. Here are the available metadata keys:
    title - sets the list page title
    publish_at - the publish date, formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`
    description - the list page description
    tags - comma separated values of categories to tag the list page with
    list_type - graphic indicator for the list items.  It is straight up the CSS `list-style-type` property (examples: circle, decimal, disc, square, none)

## Formatting

Hyperlinks
    Hyperlinks are created by writing a line like `=> <hyperlink here>`.  For a custom link text, put another string after the link. Examples:
        => https://petter.envall.se/
        => https://petter.envall.se/ My home page

Images
    Images are created by writing a line like `=< <image src>`.  To set an alt-text, put another string after the src URL. Examples:
        =< https://picsum.photos/120/80?random=1
        =< https://picsum.photos/120/80?random=2 Some image

Headings
    Headings terminate any ongoing list, so that a new one may start
    There are two levels of headings, h1 and h2
    They are created by entering a line like `# <some text>` or `## <some text>`, respectively


Block quote indication
    Block quote indication is done by entering a line like `> <some citation>`.  Example:
    > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Veniam architecto ad earum veritatis et sed harum id, enim aliquam modi. Similique error exercitationem alias cum natus non saepe officia quo.

Preformatting
    Preformatting is done by starting the line with ```, and closing the list item with entering ``` (and noting else!) at the start of a new line.  Example:
    ```Preformnatted text
```
    Normal
    Line items
